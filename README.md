🧩 Day 1 – Introduction to SQL | hashtag#SQLWithIDC
Excited to start Day 1 of the SQL 21 Days Challenge by Indian Data Club, sponsored by DPDzero! 🎉

🧠 Topics learned:
 Database commands: USE, DROP, ALTER
 Data retrieval basics: SELECT, column selection, viewing table structure (using commands like DESCRIBE or SHOW COLUMNS)
 Data filtering and display: WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET

Also practiced a few queries such as:
 ✅ Displaying the first N records from a table
 ✅ Listing specific columns from a table
 ✅ Finding unique records using DISTINCT

💡 Practice Questions:
1. Retrieve all columns from the patients table.
2. Select only the patient_id, name, and age columns from the patients table.
3. Display the first 10 records from the services_weekly table.

🧩 Daily Challenge:
Question: List all unique hospital services available in the hospital.

SELECT DISTINCT service AS services_available 
FROM services_weekly;

Excited for the upcoming days of the challenge and for continuing to improve my SQL skills.

 A big thanks to Indian Data Club and DPDzero for making learning engaging and community driven. 🙌
